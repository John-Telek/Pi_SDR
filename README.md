# Pi_SDR
SDR ISO package for the Raspberry Pi 4b

I wanted a dedicated, portable SDR package that was physically small in size for field work.
There are several Amature Radio linux distros available for PC's with SDR but nothing as complete
ffor th Pi.

On this site you will find an ISO image thats just plug in and boot. It contains the following.

(1) SDRAnglel

(2) SigDigger

(3) SDRplusplus

(4) Cubic SDR

(5) GQRX


Once you have the ISO, just plug it in and boot. Username: user, Password: password

Feel free to report any issues or if you'd like to see something else added.
